# badnest

A bad Nest integration. 


## This Fork (opq8)

- Original project was created and now deleted by [USA-RedDragon](https://github.com/USA-RedDragon). The name of the integration comes from the original author.
- First revival of the project was by [therealryanbonham](https://github.com/therealryanbonham/badnest).
- Second revival of the project was by [OscarHanzely](https://github.com/OscarHanzely/badnest) and includes refactor, added binary sensors (motion detection, house occupancy, health status) and added attributes (replacement and manufacturing dates, serial number etc.) centered around Nest Protect.
- Also includes minor changes from [MSkjel](https://github.com/MSkjel/badnest).

## Features

- Works with migrated/new accounts via Google auth
- Nest Protect support
- Nest Thermostat support
- Nest Thermostat Sensor support
- Nest Camera support

## Install
The easiest way to install the Badnest integration is with [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/). First install HACS if you donâ€™t have it yet. After installation, you can find this integration in the HACS store under integrations.

Alternatively, you can install it manually. Just copy and paste the content of the badnest/custom_components folder in your config/custom_components directory. As example, you will get the sensor.py file in the following path: /config/custom_components/badnest/sensor.py. The disadvantage of a manual installation is that updates are manual as well.

## Configuration

The camera's region is one of `us` or `eu` depending on your region.
If you're not in the US or EU, you should be able to add your
two-character country code, and it should work.

### Example configuration.yaml - When you are using the Google Auth Login

```yaml
badnest:
  issue_token: "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/iframerpc....."
  cookie: "OCAK=......"
  region: us

climate:
  - platform: badnest
    scan_interval: 10

camera:
  - platform: badnest

```

Google Login support added with many thanks to: chrisjshull from <https://github.com/chrisjshull/homebridge-nest/>

The values of `"issue_token"` and `"cookie"` are specific to your Google Account. To get them, follow these steps (only needs to be done once, as long as you stay logged into your Google Account).

1. Open a Chrome browser tab in Incognito Mode (or clear your cache).
2. Open Developer Tools (View/Developer/Developer Tools).
3. Click on 'Network' tab. Make sure 'Preserve Log' is checked.
4. In the 'Filter' box, enter `issueToken`
5. Go to `home.nest.com`, and click 'Sign in with Google'. Log into your account.
6. One network call (beginning with `iframerpc`) will appear in the Dev Tools window. Click on it.
7. In the Headers tab, under General, copy the entire `Request URL` (beginning with `https://accounts.google.com`, ending with `nest.com`). This is your `"issue_token"` in `configuration.yaml`.
8. In the 'Filter' box, enter `oauth2/iframe`
9. Several network calls will appear in the Dev Tools window. Click on the last `iframe` call.
10. In the Headers tab, under Request Headers, copy the entire `cookie` (beginning `OCAK=...` or `__Host-GAPS=` - **include the whole string which is several lines long and has many field/value pairs** - do not include the `cookie:` name). This is your `"cookie"` in `configuration.yaml`.

## Notes

The target temperature reported by the integration sometimes _seems_ to be slightly off by a few tens of a degree.
This is caused by the fact that the Nest mobile app actually actually allows users to set the temperature in small
increments, but the displayed temperature is rounded to the nearest 0.5 degree. In other words, the temperature
displayed by the integration is correct, just _more exact_ than what is shown in the app.
